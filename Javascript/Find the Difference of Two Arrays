In this lab, you have to implement a function findDifference that will take two 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2. You should return a list answer of size 2 where:

answer[0] is a list of all distinct integers in nums1 which are not present in nums2.
answer[1] is a list of all distinct integers in nums2 which are not present in nums1.
The integers in the lists may be returned in any order.

Here are some examples of the findDifference function:

findDifference([1,2,3], [2,4,6]);
// Output: [[1,3],[4,6]]

findDifference([1,2,3,3], [1,1,2,2]);
 // Output: [[3],[]]

Solution
-------------
const findDifference = function (nums1, nums2) {
	const set1 = new Set(nums1)
	const set2 = new Set(nums2)

	const diff1 = [...set1].filter((x) => !set2.has(x))
	const diff2 = [...set2].filter((x) => !set1.has(x))

	return [diff1, diff2]
}
