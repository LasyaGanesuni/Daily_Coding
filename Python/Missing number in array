class Solution:
    def missingNumber(self,a,n):
        # code here
        a=list(a)
        k=(n*(n+1))/2
        p=k-sum(a)
        return int(p)

Approach 3 (Using Cyclic Sort): The idea behind it is as follows:

All the given array numbers are sorted and in the range of 1 to n-1. If the range is 1 to N  then the index of every array element will be the same as (value - 1).

Follow the below steps to implement the idea:

Use cyclic sort to sort the elements in linear time.
Now traverse from i = 0 to the end of the array:
If arr[i] is not the same as i+1 then the missing element is (i+1).
If all elements are present then N is the missing element in the range [1, N].
